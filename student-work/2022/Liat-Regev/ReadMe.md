## About
Hi there! I'm Liat.
I write, so you can read less and do more. My background as an information specialist helps me distill long and complex information into a digestable text. I like exploring new technologies, tools, and programming languages. Other than that, I like chubby cats, gourmet pastries, and exercising in slow motion.
