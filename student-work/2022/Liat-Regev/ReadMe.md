## About
Hi there! I'm Liat.
I write, so you can read less and do more. I’m a junior technical writer based in Israel. My background as an information specialist helps me distill long and complex information into a digestable text. I like exploring new technologies, tools, and programming languages. Other than that, I like chubby cats, gourmet pastries, and exercising in slow motion.  You can check out my website here: https://liatregev.netlify.app
