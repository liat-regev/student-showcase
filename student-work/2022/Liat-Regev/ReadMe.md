## About
Hi there! I'm Liat.   
I’m a junior technical writer based in Israel. My background as an information specialist helps me distill long and complex information into a digestable text.  
I like exploring new technologies, tools, and programming languages. Other than that, I like chubby cats, gourmet pastries, and using a multitude of lists to demonstrate my command on the serial comma.
